As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved throughout 2020 and 2021, multiple variants emerged, contributing to multiple surges in cases of COVID-19 worldwide. In 2021, highly effective vaccines became available, although the pandemic continues into 2022. There has been tremendous expansion of basic, translational, and clinical knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 since the pandemic's onset. Treatment options have been rapidly explored, attempting to repurpose preexisting medications in tandem with development and evaluation of novel agents. Care of the seriously ill patient is examined.\n",

      "abstract:  Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), biomarkers for evaluating severity, as well as supportive care to improve clinical course, remain insufficient. We explored the potential of d-amino acids, rare enantiomers of amino acids, as biomarkers for assessing disease severity and as protective nutrients against severe viral infections. In mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV) and in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring artificial ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, blood levels of d-amino acids, including d-alanine, were reduced significantly compared with those of uninfected mice or healthy controls. In mice models of IAV infection or COVID-19, supplementation with d-alanine alleviated severity of clinical course, and mice with sustained blood levels of d-alanine showed favorable prognoses. In severe viral infections, blood levels of d-amino acids, including d-alanine, decrease, and supplementation with d-alanine improves prognosis. d-Alanine has great potentials as a biomarker and a therapeutic option for severe viral infections.\n",

      "abstract:  Energy crisis and increasing rigorous management standards pose significant challenges for solid waste management worldwide. Several emerging diseases such as COVID-19 aggravated the already complex solid waste management crisis, especially sewage sludge and food waste streams, because of the increasingly large production year by year. As mature waste disposal technologies, landfills, incineration, composting, and some other methods are widespread for solid wastes management. This paper reviews recent advances in key sewage sludge disposal technologies. These include incineration, anaerobic digestion, and valuable products oriented-conversion. Food waste disposal technologies comprised of thermal treatment, fermentation, value-added product conversion, and composting have also been described. The hot topic and dominant research foci of each area are summarized, simultaneously compared with conventional technologies in terms of organic matter degradation or conversion performance, energy generation, and renewable resources production. Future perspectives of each technology that include issues not well understood and predicted challenges are discussed with a positive effect on the full-scale implementation of the discussed disposal methods.\n",

      "abstract:  Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are a research approach used to identify genetic variants associated with common diseases, like COVID-19. The lead genetic variants (n = 41) reported by the eleven largest COVID-19 GWASs are mapped to 22 different chromosomal regions. The loci 3q21.31 (LZTFL1 and chemokine receptor genes) and 9q34.2 (ABO), associated with disease severity and susceptibility to infection, respectively, were the most replicated findings across studies. Genes involved with mucociliary clearance (CEP97, FOXP4), viral-entry (ACE2, SLC6A20) and mucosal immunity (MIR6891) are associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while genes of antiviral immune response (IFNAR2, OAS1), leukocyte trafficking (CCR9, CXCR6) and lung injury (DPP9, NOTCH4) are associated with severe disease. The biological processes underlying the risk of infection occur prominently, but not exclusively, in the upper airways whereas the severe COVID-19-associated processes in alveolar-capillary interface. The COVID-19 GWASs has unraveled key genetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, although the genetic basis of other COVID-19 related phenotypes (long COVID and neurological impairment) remains to be elucidated.\n",

      "abstract:  The aim of this study was to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is detectable after municipal wastewater treatment and to verify its expected removal from purified water that is reclaimed for potable reuse. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 genes) were monitored in raw influent wastewater (sewage) entering a water reclamation facility and in subsequent advanced treatment. Despite the large viral RNA load in raw sewage during peak COVID-19 outbreaks, substantial amounts of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material were removed during the conventional wastewater treatment process. Further, SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was undetectable after advanced purification. This confirms that potable reuse is resilient against high viral loads which are expected given the advanced degree of wastewater and water treatment. Findings from this study may enhance public perception of the safety of potable water reuse; however, it should also be noted that studies to date worldwide indicate no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via water, and the CDC does not consider fecal waste or wastewaters as a source of exposure.\n",

      "abstract:  In humans, coronaviruses are the cause of endemic illness and have been the causative agents of more severe epidemics. Most recently, SARS-CoV-2 was the causative agent of the COVID19 pandemic. Thus, there is a high interest in developing therapeutic agents targeting various stages of the coronavirus viral life cycle to disrupt viral propagation. Besides the development of small-molecule therapeutics that target viral proteases, there is also interest molecular tools to inhibit the initial event of viral attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to host ACE2 surface receptor. Here, we leveraged known structural information and peptide arrays to develop an in vitro peptide inhibitor of the Spike-ACE2 interaction. First, from previous co-crystal structures of the Spike-ACE2 complex, we identified an initial 24-residue long region (sequence: STIEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQ) on the ACE2 sequence that encompasses most of the known contact residues. Next, we scanned this 24-mer window along the ACE2 N-terminal helix and found that maximal binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (CoV2-RBD) was increased when this window was shifted nine residues in the N-terminal direction. Further, by systematic permutation of this shifted ACE2-derived peptide we identified mutations to the wildtype sequence that confer increased binding of the CoV2-RBD. Among these peptides, we identified binding peptide 19 (referred to as BP19; sequence: SLVAVTAAQSTIEEQAKTFLDKFI) as an in vitro inhibitor of the Spike-ACE2 interaction with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.08 ± 0.38μM. Overall, BP19 adds to the arsenal of Spike-ACE2 inhibitors, and this study highlights the utility of systematic peptide arrays as a platform for the development of coronavirus protein inhibitors.\n",

      "abstract:  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease of 2019) pandemic, myocarditis has received much attention and controversy as one of the more worrisome cardiovascular complications. After the availability of highly effective COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in late 2020, myocarditis was also appreciated as an important vaccine-related adverse event. Though the overall frequency of clinically evident viral myocarditis is rare in the general population, young males show a higher predilection for COVID vaccine-induced myocarditis. The severity of COVID-19 viral myocarditis is variable, ranging from very mild to severe, while vaccine-induced myocarditis is usually mild, and rarely a severe or fatal disease. The diagnosis of either COVID-19 or vaccine-induced myocarditis is based on typical clinical features, laboratory investigations, and imaging, preferably with cardiac magnetic resonance. The management of COVID-19 myocarditis is supportive care for mild or moderate disease. For the rare patient who develops severe disease, advanced heart failure therapies such as mechanical circulatory support devices may have to be employed and can be lifesaving. Avoidance of strenuous exercise during the bout of myocarditis and its recovery phase is important. Despite the small but finite risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis, the benefits of protection against COVID-19 disease and its attendant complications far outweigh the risks.\n",

When a shield, such as acrylic boards or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheets, was used as the countermeasure, the deposition of artificial droplets (>4 μm), emitted from beside or behind the driver, on his eyes, mouth, and cheeks reduced by two to three orders of magnitude or more. Deposition on the surfaces around the driver was also reduced following the use of shields. For artificial droplet nuclei (1.3 μm of polystyrene latex (PSL)) emitted from atomizers beside the driver, the operation of the ventilation fan (VF) and air conditioner (AC), and defroster (DEF) greatly reduced the driver's exposure, while the use of the shield did not. The infection risk of the driver was estimated through exposure to the virus via transfer to the mucosa via hands or surface-to-finger, direct adhesion on the mucosa, and direct inhalation of droplets and droplet nuclei. This is under the assumption that the droplets and droplet nuclei measured in this study are 40% the diameter of those after immediately leaving the mouth of the infected person and are constant regardless of particle size. When using the shield, total infection risk via droplet, airborne, and contact transmission was decreased by 75.0-99.8%. When the shield was not installed, the infection risk decreased by 9.74-48.7% with the operation of the VF, AC, and/or DEF.\n",

In this study, the study describes for a period of five years (2018-2022) how the faunal community have been affected by human disturbances, as well as the effect of the \"anthropause\" period driven by the COVID-19 lockdown. The results confirmed human disturbances on faunal communities related to coastal urbanization. It was found that the \"anthropause\" period showed the highest values of abundance and biomass, hence the \"COVID-19 lockdown\" allowed recovery of faunal communities. The findings highlight the impact of human disturbances and that the community showed resilience. Overall, the authorities must perform restrictive measures aiming to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities in the study area including the banning of off-road and recreational vehicles, carrying out efficient cleaning and grooming operations, monitoring the severe harvesting of edible species, as well as penalizing the disposal of anthropogenic waste and sewage discharge from the touristic facilities. Likewise, management actions such as the temporal beach closures and the regular surveillance could be advantageous to provide a more sustainable exploitation of sandy beaches.\n",

Co-infections/secondary infections continue to plague patients around the world as result of the co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, biochemical changes caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) especially significant elevation in free iron levels, immune suppression caused by SARS-CoV-2, and indiscriminate use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. In such circumstances, opportunistic fungal infections pose significant challenge for COVID-19 disease therapy in patients with other co-morbidities. Although COVID-19-associated Mucormycosis (CAM) has been widely recognized, currently extensive research is being conducted on mucormycosis. It has been widely agreed that patients undergoing corticosteroid therapy are highly susceptible for CAM, henceforth high index of screening and intensive care and management is need of an hour in order to have favorable outcomes in these patients. Diagnosis in such cases is often delayed and eventually the disease progresses quickly which poses added burden to clinician and increases patient load in critical care units of hospitals. A vast perusal of literature indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus and those with other co-morbidities might be highly vulnerable to develop mucormycosis. In the present work, the case series of three patients presented at Chest Disease Hospital Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir infected with CAM has been described with their epidemiological data in supplementary section. All these cases were found to be affected with co-morbidity of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and were under corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, given the significant death rate linked with mucormycosis and the growing understanding of the diseases significance, systematic review of the literature on CAM has been discussed and we have attempted to discuss emerging CAM and related aspects of the disease.\n",

This study aimed to compare reactogenicity and NAbs generated by three different COVID-19 vaccine platforms in individuals with and without prior COVID-19. 336 individuals vaccinated (112 with CoronaVac [inactivated virus], 112 with BNT162b2 [messenger RNA], and 112 with Ad5-nCoV [non-replicating viral vector]) were included. NAbs were quantified with the cPass SARS-CoV-2 kit. Individuals immunized with the Ad5-nCoV showed higher reactogenicity than those immunized with the other vaccines (p < 0.001). The BTN162b2 vaccine-induced NAbs with higher inhibition capacity than the other platforms in the first dose. In individuals without prior COVID-19, the Ad5-nCoV vaccine generated lower NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 than those induced by two doses of the BTN162b2 (Ad5-nCoV 72.10 [55.6-93.4] vs. BTN162b2 98.41 [98.16-98.56], p < 0.0001). One individual did not generate NAbs (0.89%) after a complete immunization with CoronaVac; in BTN162b2, all generated these antibodies, and in the Ad5-nCoV group, four individuals (3.57%) did not generate NAbs. Comorbidities, gender, age, and reactogenicity did not significantly influence the generation of NAbs (p > 0.05); however, a history of COVID-19 before vaccination was associated with antibodies with greater neutralizing capacity after the first dose (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the mRNA vaccine (BTN162b2) had a remarkable better ability to produce NAbs and lower reactogenicity than the other platforms, whereas the Ad5-nCov vaccine induced the lowest NAbs response in individuals without a history of COVID-19; therefore, we suggest that a booster could benefit these individuals.\n",

A diverse STEM workforce contributes to better problem-solving and equity in health care. Two of the many major barriers for rural students are the lack of sufficient STEM role models and limited access to technology in the classroom. Medical schools often serve as an important resource for students in the local community who can easily gain access to STEM professionals and modern technology through on-campus, sponsored events and STEM outreach to the local classrooms. However, underrepresented minority (URM) students often live in socioeconomically distressed parts of rural states such as Arkansas, where access to STEM role models and technology is limited.

      "abstract:  The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the constellation of symptoms that characterize COVID-19 are only incompletely understood. In an effort to fill these gaps, a \"nicotinic hypothesis,\" which posits that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) act as additional severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptors, has recently been put forth. A key feature of the proposal (with potential clinical ramifications) is the suggested competition between the virus' spike protein and small-molecule cholinergic ligands for the receptor's orthosteric binding sites. This notion is reminiscent of the well-established role of the muscle AChR during rabies virus infection. To address this hypothesis directly, we performed equilibrium-type ligand-binding competition assays using the homomeric human α7-AChR (expressed on intact cells) as the receptor, and radio-labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx) as the orthosteric-site competing ligand. We tested different SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides, the S1 domain, and the entire S1-S2 ectodomain, and found that none of them appreciably outcompete [<sup>125</sup>I]-α-BgTx in a specific manner. Furthermore, patch-clamp recordings showed no clear effect of the S1 domain on α7-AChR-mediated currents. We conclude that the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human α7-AChR's orthosteric sites-and thus, its competition with ACh, choline, or nicotine-is unlikely to be a relevant aspect of this complex disease.\n",

      "abstract:  Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a new pneumonia which is extremely infectious, the classification of this coronavirus is essential to effectively control the development of the epidemic. Pathological changes in the chest computed tomography (CT) scans are often used as one of the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19. Meanwhile, deep learning-based transfer learning is currently an effective strategy for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). To further improve the performance of deep transfer learning model used for COVID-19 classification with CT images, in this article, we propose a hybrid model combined with a semi-supervised domain adaption model and extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier, and the application of a novel multikernel correntropy induced loss function in transfer learning is also presented. The proposed model is evaluated on open-source datasets. The experimental results are compared to some baseline models to verify the effectiveness, while adopting accuracy, precision, recall, F<sub>1</sub> score and area under curve (AUC) as the evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance of original model and is more suitable for CT images analysis.\n",

      "abstract:  This paper proposes a compartment model (SVEIHRM model) based on a system of ordinary differential equations to simulate the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Emergence of mutant viruses gave rise to multiple peaks in the number of confirmed cases. Vaccine developers and WHO suggest individuals to receive multiple vaccinations (the primary and the secondary vaccinations and booster shots) to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. Taking this into account, we include compartments for multiple vaccinations and mutant viruses of COVID-19 in the model. In particular, our model considers breakthrough infection according to the antibody formation rate following multiple vaccinations. We obtain the effective reproduction numbers of the original virus, the Delta, and the Omicron variants by fitting this model to data in Korea. Additionally, we provide various simulations adjusting the daily vaccination rate and the timing of vaccination to investigate the effects of these two vaccine-related measures on the number of infected individuals. We also show that starting vaccinations early is the key to reduce the number of infected individuals. Delaying the start date requires increasing substantially the rate of vaccination to achieve similar target results. In the sensitivity analysis on the vaccination rate of Korean data, it is shown that a 10% increase (decrease) in vaccination rates can reduce (increase) the number of confirmed cases by 35.22% (82.82%), respectively.\n",

      "abstract:  Estimating the burden of COVID-19 in India is difficult because the extent to which cases and deaths have been undercounted is hard to assess. Here, we use a 9-component, age-stratified, contact-structured epidemiological compartmental model, which we call the INDSCI-SIM model, to analyse the first wave of COVID-19 spread in India. We use INDSCI-SIM, together with Bayesian methods, to obtain optimal fits to daily reported cases and deaths across the span of the first wave of the Indian pandemic, over the period Jan 30, 2020 to Feb 15, 2021. We account for lock-downs and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), an overall increase in testing as a function of time, the under-counting of cases and deaths, and a range of age-specific infection-fatality ratios. We first use our model to describe data from all individual districts of the state of Karnataka, benchmarking our calculations using data from serological surveys. We then extend this approach to aggregated data for Karnataka state. We model the progress of the pandemic across the cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai, and then for India as a whole. We estimate that deaths were undercounted by a factor between 2 and 5 across the span of the first wave, converging on 2.2 as a representative multiplier that accounts for the urban-rural gradient. We also estimate an overall under-counting of cases by a factor of between 20 and 25 towards the end of the first wave. Our estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) are in the range 0.05-0.15, broadly consistent with previous estimates but substantially lower than values that have been estimated for other LMIC countries. We find that approximately 35% of India had been infected overall by the end of the first wave, results broadly consistent with those from serosurveys. These results contribute to the understanding of the long-term trajectory of COVID-19 in India.\n",

      "abstract:  The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has placed a significant burden on public health systems to provide swift and accurate diagnostic testing highlighting the critical need for innovative testing approaches for future pandemics. In this study, we present a novel sample pooling procedure based on compressed sensing theory to accurately identify virally infected patients at high prevalence rates utilizing an innovative viral RNA extraction process to minimize sample dilution. At prevalence rates ranging from 0-14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 69.26% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Our method provided quantification of individual sample viral load within a pool as well as a binary positive-negative result. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased. Compressed sensing can be adapted to a wide variety of diagnostic testing applications to increase throughput for routine laboratory testing as well as a means to increase testing capacity to combat future pandemics.\n",
